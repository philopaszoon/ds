* Finally, stitching all the columns together to pass through a random forest (I tried two of them, actually).  It's pretty self explanatory. The one-hot encoded first_word data makes it look bigger and messier than it is.  The final result (accuracy =  0.77) is in line what I expected given that I'm not using group IDs or estimated metagroup IDs at all (most of the Kaggle submissions do use that information in some form) and that the scoring is so often suspect.
