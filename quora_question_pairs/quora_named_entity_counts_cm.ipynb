    "... even though the term, \"of the US\", in one sentence contains a named entity that is not present in the other which, all by itself, seems like a good reason to consider them different.  \n",
    "\n",
    "How do we, human readers, know that the term \"of the US\" is not critical to the meaning of the first sentence?  It's because Donald Trump could not possibly be president of any other country.  To make this determination in code, we would like to be able to observe two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1) the US is a country (or a place, more generally).\n",
    "* 2) the term \"Donald Trump\" is much, much more likely to be associated with the US than with any other place.\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem is that it isn't entirely true!  Even if we include all the nouns in the sentence [Donald, Trump, President, US], replacing \"US\" with another place name like \"China\" doesn't necessarily lessen the odds of the sentence because \"President Trump discusses China\" .. all the time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Only by focusing in on the specific phrase \"president of the US\", then replacing \"US\" with \"China\", could we discover that no country other than the US could fit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But that's a very specific condition. Most prepositional phrases do not have such resonance because most have not risen to the status of being an idiom, as \"president of the US\" has.  This phrase is really a 4-gram that happens to yield an unusually strong signal.  The fact that it's also a prepositional phrase is incedental.  \n",

It's fairly good with person names and the names of well known locations, but the guesses that it makes about what sort of named entity a given word represents are not consistently good enough to be used in the way that I would like.  Thus, another task for future sessions is to improve this facility in order to improve the overall process in this notebook.\n",

    "Here's how the exagerating actually happens.  In a Dynamic Time Warp Distance calculation, vectors that are set at a different angle by rotating them as below will result in significantly larger measured distances between sentences IF the rotated word is not present in both sentences.  However, if the rotated word is present in both sentences, the measurement will not be any different than if the words had not been rotated, since in both cases the words will be found to match. "

It would be helpful to know that a Yorkie is actually a kind of dog, and further to know that the kind of dog doesn't matter very much and that the thing being chewed by the dog doesn't matter very much.  Dogs chew stuff and humans are engaged in a broad conversation about it.  Somehow, that's what we need to know."
